# Dynamic-Routes-Part-1
task 8
Dynamic routing, also called adaptive routing, is a process where a router can forward data via a different route for a given destination based on the current conditions of the communication circuits within a system.

Routing is a procedure of making decisions in which the router (which is a hardware device used in networking to receive and send data in the form of packets on a network) selects the best path to make data transfer from source to destination. A router exists in the network layer in the OSI as well as TCP/IP model. Some functions of a router are:

Building an optimal path on a network to reach its destination (in which static and dynamic routing take place).
Taking routing decisions.
Balancing load.
Types of Routing:
Static routing
Default routing
Dynamic routing
Static and Default routing has some drawbacks, due to which Dynamic Routing was introduced.

Drawbacks of Static Routing:
It is a burdensome task to sum up or add-on each route manually to the routing map in a large network.
Managing its ordering is time-consuming.
It cannot reroute traffic in case some link fails.
Drawbacks of Default routing was:
If the network is complex then it is more difficult to set up.
To overcome the shortcomings of static and default routing, Back in the 1980s, the first-ever Dynamic routing was used in a computer and the protocol which was used in it was the RIP(routing information protocol). 

Dynamic Routing
Dynamic routing is known as a technique of finding the best path for the data to travel over a network in this process a router can transmit data through various different routes and reach its destination on the basis of conditions at that time of communication circuits.
